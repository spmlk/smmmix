<h1 align="center">spiltmilk's Mapping Mix</h1>
<div align="center">
A first foray into Java modding for Mindustry, this mod serves as a repository of blocks, floors and other additions that introduce or enhance the custom mapping experience content-wise.

Sample maps featuring these blocks will be included (in time).

### Content Overview
* `1` floor
* `2` walls
* `1` prop
* `1` building (editor only, like everything else listed)

## Using the Mod
Like most Mindustry mods featuring the **mindustry-mod** tag, this mod is available on the in-game mod browser.

Unreleased builds can be found at the [Actions tab](https://github.com/spmlk/smmmix/actions) of this repository, where workflows marked with a :white_check_mark: green check mark will contain a ZIP of the respective build.

Do note that Java mods like this one do not function on iOS.

This mod is intended for use with **7.0 Build 146**; this will be indicated when playing with an older Mindustry release. Using the mod on Bleeding Edge may have unintended consequences.
